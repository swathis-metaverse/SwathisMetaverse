					As a second-year Computer Science student at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB), I am deeply passionate about exploring the realms of technology and programming. My journey in the field of computer science has been marked by a curiosity-driven pursuit of knowledge, coupled with a strong desire to innovate and create solutions to real-world problems. From delving into algorithms and data structures to mastering various programming languages, I am continuously honing my skills to become a proficient software developer. Beyond the confines of the classroom, I actively seek opportunities to engage in hands-on projects, collaborate with peers, and participate in hackathons and coding competitions. With a solid foundation in theoretical concepts and practical experience, I am eager to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and make a meaningful impact in the field of Computer Science.

					I grew up on a ranch, where my early experiences riding horses and playing with Legos sparked a lifelong passion for exploration and creativity. I've always been drawn to challenging environments, believing that they're essential for growth and learning. This curiosity and desire to push boundaries led me to pursue computer science. Through computer science, I've embraced the process of learning from both successes and setbacks, viewing each as an opportunity to improve and innovate. I am deeply grateful for the experiences and challenges that have brought me here, especially the opportunity to work with an incredible team and organization. Their support has been instrumental in my journey. I'm genuinely excited to be part of this community, ready to contribute, learn, and grow together. I am absolutely stoked to be here.				</p>

					As a kid I was captivated by Minecraft and Legos which grew into teaching coding to kids and diving deep into my Computer Science theory. My journey has been all about transforming imagination into reality. As a sophomore with a keen interest in front-end development, I've learned to appreciate the elegance of simple solutions and the power of intuitive design. Teaching has reinforced my belief in coding as a universal language of creativity, and I'm thrilled I get to create something awesome in this hackathon. It's an opportunity to apply my skills, challenge myself, and collaborate with others in a fast-paced environment. This journey from playful exploration to serious engineering has profoundly shaped how I view the world, making me eager to build, learn, and grow in every opportunity that comes my way.
